# -Forest-Cover-Type-Classification
This project focuses on predicting the **type of forest cover** based on **cartographic and environmental features** such as elevation, slope, and soil types using machine learning. We implemented and compared Random Forest and XGBoost models to achieve high classification performance on the UCI Covertype dataset.
